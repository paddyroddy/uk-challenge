## Formatting

To install `pre-commit` hooks locally, execute `pip install pre-commit`
followed by `pre-commit install`. This only needs to be done once per repo,
and from then on checks are made whenever committing. See steps
[here](https://pre-commit.com/#automatically-enabling-pre-commit-on-repositories)
to enable these checks always.

## Automatically switch conda environment

With the help of `direnv` and the
[following](https://github.com/paddyroddy/dotfiles/blob/main/direnv/.direnvrc)
in `~/.direnv` then one can switch `conda` environments automatically with the
presence of `layout anaconda <environment>` in the project's `.envrc`.
